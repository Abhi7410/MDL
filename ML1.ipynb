    "<p>As its name suggests, <b>Supervised machine learning</b> is based on supervision. It means in the supervised learning technique, we train the machines using the \"labelled\" dataset, and based on the training, the machine predicts the output. Here, the labelled data specifies that some of the inputs are already mapped to the output. More preciously, we can say; first, we train the machine with the input and corresponding output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.</p>\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Example</font>\n",
    "<p>Suppose we have an input dataset of cats and dog images. So, first, we will provide the training to the machine to understand the images, such as <i>the shape & size of the tail of cat and dog, Shape of eyes, colour, height (dogs are taller, cats are smaller), etc.</i> After completion of training, we input the picture of a cat and ask the machine to identify the object and predict the output. Now, the machine is well trained, so it will check all the features of the object, such as height, shape, colour, eyes, ears, tail, etc., and find that it's a cat. So, it will put it in the Cat category. This is the process of how the machine identifies the objects in Supervised Learning.</p>\n",

    "<p>Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that lies between Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning. It represents the intermediate ground between Supervised (With Labelled training data) and Unsupervised learning (with no labelled training data) algorithms and uses the combination of labelled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Semi-supervised learning is the middle ground between supervised and unsupervised learning and operates on the data that consists of a few labels, it mostly consists of unlabeled data. As labels are costly, but for corporate purposes, they may have few labels. It is completely different from supervised and unsupervised learning as they are based on the presence & absence of labels.\n",
